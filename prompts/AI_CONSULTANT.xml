<task> 
1. Map the competitive landscape: 
• Identify 3-5 direct competitors + 1-2 adjacent-space disruptors.
•
Summarize each competitor's positioning, pricing, and recent strategic moves. 2. Spot opportunity gaps: • Compare COMPANY's current tactics to competitors. • Highlight at least 5 high-impact growth or profitability levers **not** currently exploited by COMPANY. 3. Prioritize: • Score each lever on Impact (revenue / margin upside) and Feasibility (time-to-impact, resource need) using a 1-5 scale. • Recommend the top 3 actions with the strongest Impact × Feasibility. </task>
<approach> - Go VERY deep. Research far more than you normally would. Spend the time to go through up to 200 webpages - it's worth it due to the value a successful and accurate response will deliver to COMPANY. - Don't just look at articles, forums, etc. - anything is fair game... COMPANY/competitor websites, analytics platforms, etc. </approach>
