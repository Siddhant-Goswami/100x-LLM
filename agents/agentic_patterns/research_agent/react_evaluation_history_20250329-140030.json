        "Tool Usage Effectiveness": "The research demonstrates a good use of tools, particularly in combining qualitative and quantitative methods. However, the precision of web search queries and the strategy for tool combination could be improved. Recommendations include refining search queries to target more specific aspects of MCP and exploring additional data analytics tools to enhance insights.",
        "Source Quality": "The document uses a diverse range of high-quality sources, including recent academic journals and industry reports. The inclusion of expert sources adds credibility. To further improve, consider incorporating more longitudinal studies to provide deeper insights into MCP's long-term effects.",
        "Data-Driven Insights": "The report provides solid quantitative findings, such as the 15% improvement in accuracy. However, the statistical significance of these findings is not thoroughly evaluated. Future iterations should include more detailed statistical analysis and clearer data visualizations to enhance understanding.",
        "Research Depth": "While the report covers technical concepts and multiple perspectives, it lacks depth in exploring state-of-the-art developments and future directions. Expanding on these areas and integrating more cutting-edge research would strengthen the report.",
        "Actionable Output": "The report offers practical recommendations but lacks detailed implementation guidance and awareness of limitations. To improve, provide more specific steps for implementation and a clearer discussion of potential challenges and mitigation strategies."
